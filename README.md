## üìù Editing Content

### Blog Posts & Case Studies

The blog and case studies are powered by MDX. You can easily add or edit content by modifying the files in the `_posts` directory.

-   **Blog Posts**: Add/edit `.mdx` files in `_posts/blog/`.
-   **Case Studies**: Add/edit `.mdx` files in `_posts/case-studies/`.

Each file requires YAML frontmatter at the top:

```mdx
---
title: 'My Awesome Blog Post'
date: '2025-01-15'
author: 'Rabeel Ashraf'
image: '/images/blog/post-image.png'
excerpt: 'A short summary of the blog post that will appear in the list view.'
---

Your content starts here. You can use **Markdown** and even `JSX` components.
```
